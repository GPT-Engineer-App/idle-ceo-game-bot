# idle-ceo-game-bot

Create an Economy Discord bot in Python with `discord.py` and an SQLite database. The bot needs to be fully functioning in every aspect. When creating systems for this bot, make them as customizable and user-friendly as possible. Store commands in cogs, with each cog in its own Python file. Write tests for everything, and donâ€™t continue working until the tests are passed. Make sure that there is a `bot.py` that will start the bot up, includes linking with cogs, and connects to the database. The bot is supposed to be played like a game, with a theme of an "Idle CEO Game". Ensure there is early game, mid game, and end game content and balancing. Don't worry about graphics, emojis, embed images, etc.; just make placeholders for me to add them later.

### Project Requirements

#### Setup and Initialization
- **bot.py**:
  - Initialize the bot, load cogs, and connect to the SQLite database.
  - Define event listeners such as `on_ready` to confirm the bot is online and `on_message` for custom message handling if needed.

#### Database
- **SQLite Database**:
  - Serve as the backbone of the bot, storing all relevant data.
  - Use a defined schema to ensure data integrity and consistency.

#### Database Schema
- **Tables**:
  - **Users**: Contains columns for `user_id`, `username`, `balance`, and `created_at` to track user information.
  - **Businesses**: Contains columns for `business_id`, `user_id`, `business_name`, `level`, `revenue_rate`, `perk`, and `created_at` to track user-owned businesses and their details.
  - **Transactions**: Contains columns for `transaction_id`, `user_id`, `amount`, `transaction_type`, and `timestamp` to log all financial transactions.
  - **Shop**: Contains columns for `shop_id`, `user_id`, `business_id`, `price`, and `timestamp` to manage the user shop for selling businesses.

#### db_manager.py
- Centralize all database interactions in this file.
- Example functions: `get_balance`, `update_balance`, `register_user`, `get_user_profile`, `add_business`, `upgrade_business`, `get_business_revenue`, `get_random_perk`, `add_business_to_shop`, `buy_business_from_shop`.

#### Cogs and Commands
- **Economy Cog**:
  - Commands related to the economy, including checking balances, earning money, and spending money.
  - Interactions with the database to fetch user balances, update balances after earnings or spendings.
  - Examples: `balance` (to check current balance), `earn` (to add a fixed amount to the balance), `spend` (to deduct an amount from the balance).

- **Users Cog**:
  - Commands related to user management, such as registering new users and viewing user profiles.
  - Interactions with the database to add new users and retrieve user profile information.
  - Examples: `register` (to create a new user in the database), `profile` (to display the user's profile information).

- **Business Cog**:
  - Commands related to business management, including starting a business, upgrading businesses, and generating revenue.
  - Implement an idle system where businesses generate revenue automatically over time.
  - Background tasks that periodically update user balances based on business revenue.
  - Examples: `start_business` (to add a new business for the user at a cost), `upgrade_business` (to level up a business and increase its revenue rate), `generate_revenue` (automated task to add revenue to users based on their businesses).

- **Admin Cog**:
  - Admin commands for managing the game, such as adding money to users or resetting user data.
  - Requires special permissions to execute these commands.
  - Examples: `add_money` (to add a specified amount to a user's balance), `reset_user` (to reset a user's data).

- **Shop Cog**:
  - Commands related to the user shop, where users can buy and sell businesses.
  - Managing the shop inventory and transactions.
  - Examples: `list_business` (to list a business for sale), `buy_business` (to buy a listed business).

#### Gameplay Phases
1. **Early Game**:
   - Users can register and start owning their first business.
   - Focus on initial growth and accumulating basic resources.
   - Commands: `register`, `start_business`, `earn`, `balance`.

2. **Mid Game**:
   - Users can manage and upgrade multiple businesses, explore the user shop for new opportunities.
   - Introduce more complex mechanics like business upgrades, perks, and strategic investments.
   - Commands: `start_business`, `upgrade_business`, `generate_revenue`, `list_business`, `buy_business`.

3. **End Game**:
   - Users aim to own 10+ businesses, including a few legendary businesses with special perks.
   - Incorporate advanced business strategies, high-level upgrades, and competitive elements.
   - Commands: `balance`, `profile`, `admin commands`.

#### Additional Gameplay Features
- **Investments**:
  - Users can invest in other businesses or virtual stocks, adding more strategic depth.
  - Commands: `invest` (to invest a specified amount in a business or stock), `withdraw_investment` (to withdraw investment and realize gains or losses).

- **Achievements**:
  - Reward users for reaching milestones, such as earning a certain amount of money or owning a number of businesses.
  - Commands: `achievements` (to display a list of achievements), `claim_achievement` (to claim rewards for achievements).

#### Business Perks
- Each business has randomly assigned perks when acquired, which can influence revenue rates or other business attributes.
- Examples of perks: increased revenue rate, reduced upgrade costs, special bonuses during events.

#### User Shop
- Users can list their businesses for sale in a user shop, setting their own prices.
- Other users can browse the shop and purchase listed businesses.
- Shop transactions are logged and managed in the database.

#### Acquiring Businesses
- Users acquire businesses through a `start_business` command, which costs money to start, assigns a randomly generated name and perk.
- Businesses can also be acquired from other users via the shop.
- Starting a new business should deduct the cost from the user's balance.

#### Idle System
- Businesses generate revenue automatically based on time intervals.
- Implement a background task that periodically updates user balances based on their business revenue.
- Ensure the system is efficient and scalable to handle multiple users and businesses.

#### Testing
- Write unit tests for each command and system to ensure functionality and reliability.
- Cover all edge cases and validate that the commands interact correctly with the database.
- Ensure all tests pass before proceeding with further development.

### Additional Considerations
- Ensure all commands are documented in the README for ease of use and understanding.
- Create placeholders for graphics, emojis, and embed images for future customization.
- Maintain clean, modular, and scalable code to accommodate future expansions and updates.

This structure and outline will help create a fully functional and customizable Economy Discord bot with `discord.py`, designed to be an engaging "Idle CEO Game" experience.
